    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Maternal mortality is a major concern for the UN's sustainable development goals, with already 287,000 women dying in 2020. A predictive model can help identify high-risk patients, enabling healthcare providers to allocate resources more effectively, enhancing the likelihood of successful outcomes for both mothers and babies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we determine whether a pregnant woman faces low, medium, or high maternal health risk, thereby contributing to improved maternal health outcomes and a reduction in maternal mortality rates?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using a dataset that has been collected from 1013 pregnant women from different hospitals, clinics, and maternal health care in the rural areas of Bangladesh. This data has columns for: age, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, blood glucose, body temperature, and heart rate."

The temperature remains within the same range for all risk groups. Therefore, it would be misleading to consider temperature as a crucial factor in determining whether a pregnant woman is at high/medium/low risk.\n",

    "To visualize the distribution of each quantitative variable and its relationship with the target predictive variable, RiskLevel, we created histograms for each variable. Additionally, we used different colors to represent the 3 levels of the RiskLevel variable. \n"

    "Multifactorial Nature of Risk: The multifactorial nature of maternal health risks suggests that multiple variables collectively contribute to the overall risk assessment, highlighting that no single factor holds all the weight in determining risk.\n",
    "Identifying correlations and associations: Variables like blood pressure, body temperature, and blood sugar levels positively impact risk assessment, with older mothers having higher maternity risk.\n",

    "- Impact of Findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of variables and expected risk in the maternal health dataset can significantly influence maternal healthcare, healthcare policy, and public health initiatives.\n",
    "1) Preventive Health Education: Understanding risk factors can aid in creating health education programs promoting healthy lifestyle choices, including prenatal care, diet-related risk reduction, and general health practices among pregnant women.\n",
    "2) Evidence-Based Policy Formulation: The findings could guide the development of evidence-based policies in maternal healthcare, aiming to reduce maternal health risk factors.\n",
    "3) Research and Innovation: The findings could drive further research and innovation in maternal health, focusing on developing novel diagnostic tools, therapeutic interventions, and preventive measures to address identified risk factors, thereby improving treatment options and health outcomes for pregnant women.\n",

    "- Future Questions:\n",
    "  \n",
    "1) Personalized Care Plans: How can the insights from the predictive model be used to create personalized care plans for pregnant women, considering their individual health profiles? \n",
    "2) Monitoring and Evaluation: How can the model be integrated into the monitoring and evaluation system to identify high-risk expecting mothers and ensure frequent monitoring to enhance maternal health outcomes?"
